## About HackIndia

HackIndia was India's first large scale hackathon for students, organised by students. It brought together India's makers, designers, hackers and creators for a weekend of building cool things.

### Branding

As India's first student organised hackathon, the focus for the branding was the saffron and green from the Indian flag. The HackIndia wordmark also featured a flag over the i, which formed the centerpiece of the branding.

###### Logo, colors and typography

### Social media campaigns

HackIndia took place at a time when hackathons were only just starting to catch on in India, and there were still a lot of negative connotations associated with "hacking". As a result, the branding was designed to look as friendly as possible, and a lot of effort was put into making people aware of the concept of hackathons.

###### A personal attempt to defeat the brogrammer stereotype.

###### Kids were signing up, so we kept things PG-13.

###### All of the social media posts were designed around the same template so they looked like a cohesive part of the design.

### The Event

At HackIndia 2015, we brought together some of the nationâ€™s best artists, designers, creators, inventors and leaders of tomorrow. It was a pretty successful event (some organisational mishaps aside) and everyone took away a lot from the event.
