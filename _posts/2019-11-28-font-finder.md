###### **“Well chosen words deserve well-chosen letters.”**<br>- Robert Bringhurst, The Elements of Typographic Style

This tool allows you to browse fonts to using combinations of adjectives instead of the classification terminology used by graphic designers.

Much has been written about how good typography can complement and enhance the mood, style and tone of the text, but for years typography was the domain of specialists who honed the craft over generations of skilled workers. The age of computers lead to a democratisation of type with the technology and capability to produce typography becoming ubiquitous. This has made every layperson who arranges text electronically an unwitting typographer. Designers may spend ages agonising over the most appropriate font for a presentation, report or poster, but these kinds of artefacts are no longer created only by designers trained in typography.

Picking fonts is an exercise in decision-making. One must pick a single option out of hundreds, or potentially thousands of fonts. This can be overwhelming—the impossibility of meaningfully picking one out of a seemingly infinite list options means that many stick either with the defaults available to them, or fall back on the heuristic of using popularity to judge quality when the options have no clear differentiating factors making them better than the others.

Access to fonts has also increased exponentially. Anyone with a computer and an internet connection has access to font libraries by aggregators like Google Fonts and Adobe Fonts which give users access to thousands of high quality fonts. Many type foundries, such as Hoefler Type, also have subscription plans where their entire catalogue is available for a flat fee. However, the interfaces for accessing these fonts leave much to be desired. Typography is a tool for effective communication, and it should not be limited just to designers due to an artificial entry barrier created by technical jargon and an inability for many to express a need for a font in ways that can be understood by machines.
