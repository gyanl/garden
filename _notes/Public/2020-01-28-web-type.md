I taught a hands-on workshop called _Basics of Web Typography_ on 28 Jan 2020, as part of the 2D Visual Studies course for B.Des. students at IDC School of Design.

The workshop used an HTML/CSS [blog template](https://github.com/gyanl/web-starter) that students could use to set up their own GitHub pages hosted website. I am using this page to document some of the things I covered during the course.

**2. Add your IITB email as a secondary email**  
 [Add email](https://github.com/settings/emails)  
Your IITB email will give you free access to the Github Student Dev Pack.  

**3. Sign up for GitHub Student Developer Pack**  
 [Sign up for Student Dev Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/offers)  
This gives you a bunch of paid stuff for free while you are a student.  

**4. Download Atom**  
[Download Link](https://atom.io/)  
Atom is a free text editor for code.  

**5. Download Web Server for Chrome**  
[Download Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en)  
This Chrome app is a quick and easy way to start a server on your computer, and allows you to test your website on your computer or any other device on your network.  

## Steps for using Github Pages to host your website

1.  Fork <https://github.com/gyanl/web-starter>
2.  Rename your fork of web starter to yourgithubusername.github.io.  
    **For eg.** My username is gyanl, so I will rename the repository to gyanl.github.io
3.  Download the repository as a zip.
4.  Make changes.
5.  Upload changed files, commit.
6.  Your website is now live at yourgithubusername.github.io

## CSS Properties

### Font name

The font-family property specifies the font you want to use.

    p {
      font-family: "Roboto Condensed";
    }

### Font Stack

If the first font in the stack is not available, the second one is used and so on. It is good practice to specify 'serif' or 'sans-serif' as a fallback in case your custom font doesn't load.

    body {
      font-family: Georgia, Times, "Times New Roman", serif;
    }

### Font weight

The weight of the font you want to use. Typical nomenclature is:

-   100 Thin
-   200 Extra Light
-   300 Light
-   400 Normal
-   500 Medium
-   600 Semi Bold
-   700 Bold
-   800 Extra Bold
-   900 Ultra Bold

If the font family doesn't provide the requested weight, it will use the closest available one.

    p {
      font-family: "Roboto Condensed";
      font-weight: 800;
    }

### Font size

The size of the font you want to use.

    p {
      font-family: "Roboto Condensed";
      font-size: 12px;
    }

### Text alignment

Left, center, right or justify alignment.

    .center{
      text-align: center;
    }

    .left{
      text-align: left;
    }

    .right{
      text-align: right;
    }

    .justify{
      text-align: justify;
    }

### Text indentation

The text-indent property indents the first line of a text block.

    p {
      text-indent: 50px;
    }

### Tracking

The letter-spacing property controls the tracking between characters. It is convenient to use em as em is dependent on the current text size.

    p {
      letter-spacing: 0.1em;
    }

### Leading

The line-height property can be used to control the leading of the text. It is convenient to use em as em is dependent on the current text size.

    p {
      line-height: 1.5em; //1.5 em is 150% of text size.
    }

### Text Decoration

Add an underline, overline or strikethrough to text. You can specify the type and color of the line.

    p {
      text-decoration: underline;
      text-decoration: underline overline wavy red;
    }

### Text Transform

Capitalise first word, convert to upper or lowecase.

    p {
      text-transform: capitalise;
      text-transform: uppercase;
      text-transform: lowercase;  
    }

### Color

The color of the text in the block.

    p {
      color: #ff4343;
    }

### Background color

The background color of the block.

    p {
      background-color: #ff4343;
    }

## Pseudo classes

### :hover

Add this to a class and these rules will be activated only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the class.

    p:hover {
      background-color: #ff4343;
    }

### :first-letter

Affects only the first letter of the div.

    p::first-letter {
      font-weight: bold;
      text-transform: uppercase;
    }

### :first-line

Affects only the first line of the div.

    p::first-line {
      font-weight: bold;
      text-transform: uppercase;
    }

## Links

Links can be styled using the following properties

    a:link { color: #666666; text-decoration: none; }
    a:visited { color: #333333; }
    a:hover { text-decoration: underline; }
    a:active { color: #000000; }
