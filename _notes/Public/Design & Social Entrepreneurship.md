This course was a series of guest lectures by people in social entrepreneurship, i.e. initiatives that aim to bring change by creating value using whatever resources are available in an area. There were also some field visits to more rural parts of Maharashtra, where you get to interact with people. The diversity of invited lecturers was quite incredible, Sandesh put a lot of work into giving you a bunch of different perspectives in just 2 weeks. I think this course might not be offered this year, since the field visits were quite an important aspect of the course.
