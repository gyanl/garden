A portfolio is maybe the most important thing for a designer looking for work. I talk to a lot of early career designers who have done great work, but don't adequately show it on their portfolios. This is a list of sites that I think are great to look at for inspiration.

## Portfolios

1. <https://gyanl.com/v2>
An older version of my website that worked as a portfolio, and got me an internship at Zomato and a job at Microsoft.

2. <https://abhishk.me/>
Abhishek Sharma does a fantastic job of showing his work visually. The website has case studies about his projects and experiences, and also shows off his side projects and experience with code.

3. <https://rishivanukuru.com/>
My friend Rishi Vanukuru is a design researcher, and his website focuses on his academic work. Not every website needs to look the same, and this is a great example of carefully picking what you want to show front and centre according to your objectives.

4. <https://fedor.design/>
Fedor Shkliarau has an extremely dynamic portfolio site - he uses a lot of animations and videos to show his work.

5. <https://roman.nurik.net/projects/>
Roman Nurik has some cool projects, and he manages to show just what they do with a couple lines of text and looping videos that are only a few seconds long. Sometimes less is more.

6. <https://www.alexkaessner.de/>
I particularly like the [iPad Main Menu concept](https://ipadmenu.study/) that Alex has on his site.

7. <http://karoliskosas.com/>
Kosas Karolis' portfolio pieces do a great job of walking you through the design process - what worked, what didn't and what the final result was.

8. <https://www.arunesh.co.in/>
Arunesh Singh optimises his website for people who don't have time (reallyâ€”who does?). He uses a toggle on his portfolio pieces to let the reader switch between a quick and detailed overview.

## Blogs
These are not necessarily design portfolios, but I like how they are written and how they present ideas.

1. <https://www.arun.is/>
Arun Venkatesan writes longform pieces about design and technology (many about Apple products) and always has beautiful illustrations and photographs. I also love his writing style - he does a wonderful job of writing in depth about topics while keeping it crisp and easy to follow.

2. <https://tonsky.me/>
A blog by Nikita Prokopov, the creator of Fira Code. He writes about code and design. I love both his style of writing and the visual simplicity of the website.

3. <https://www.gwern.net/index>
This website is dark magic. I don't know how else to describe it.

4. <https://andymatuschak.org/>
I find something cool each time I look at Andy Matuschak's website. He also has a really cool [evergreen notes system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) that I hope he open sources some day.


## Other

1. <https://ikeadrift.com/>
Use the QWERTY keys on your keypad to play a sick drum beat. I love this site.

2. <https://amandayeh.com/>
A whimsical portfolio site that evokes a sense of tech nostalgia with bitmap fonts and Windows 98 style icons.

3. <https://paco.sh/>
This site looks almost confusingly minimal till you hit the command icon and realise you can find everything from there. Not sure I would recommend this approach as the only way to find content on your site, but I did find it cool.

4. <https://www.sid.today/> + <https://www.siddharthjha.com/>
Siddharth Jha's is a UX engineer, and his websites showcases some really neat touches that tend to only happen when you are a designer who can code. Check out the cool animation on the home page, and slick hover states for links!

I also really like the idea of public-by-default sites (you can see the mess of partly written thoughts I have at <https://gyanl.com/archive/>) and I hope this becomes more common. It's cool to see more raw, in-progress writing on the internet. [Siddharth writes about this here.](https://www.siddharthjha.com/blog/what-blogs-used-to-be-like)
