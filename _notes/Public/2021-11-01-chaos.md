I was reading Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, and one of the concepts the author mentions caught my attention. According to Harari, there are two main classifications of chaos.

#### First Order Chaos
*An unpredictable phenomenon that doesn’t respond to predictions.*

For eg. The weather is a chaotic system. It can't be predicted with total accuracy because of the huge number of variables involved. However, the weather does not change based on the predictions about it. 

#### Second Order Chaos 
*An unpredictable phenomenon that responds to predictions about itself.*

For eg. stocks and politics—if someone predicts that a certain stock will rise 20% tomorrow, then people will react to the prediction. This can cause demand and hence the price to go up today, which can make the prediction incorrect. 

Second order chaos is, in a sense, the opposite of a self fulfiling prophecy. By making a prediction, people will react to the prediction and make it not come true.
