#### What are numeronyms?

A numeronym is a number-based word, where the number is typically used to abbreviate the word.

One type of numeronym uses numbers that sound similar to the full word. An example is "K9" for "canine". 

Another type uses replaces the letters between the first and last letter with the number of letters omitted, such as "i18n" for "internationalization". These word shortenings are also known as alphanumeric acronyms, alphanumeric abbreviations, or numerical contractions.
