###### This was one of the weirder things I've done at college.

### What is this?

Dots is an an experimental installation I worked on with my friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/doodler_blue/">Rashmi</a> in my first semester at IDC School of Design. We wanted to create a fun installation that could grab the attention of someone passing by it, and let people explore what it could do without any explanations.

### How did we do it?

We started out by trying to use Processing and the input from a video camera to try and allow people to 'paint' on a screen by moving their arms in front of it. The camera input turned out to be a slow and inefficient way of detecting gestures, and our instructor for the course suggested we use a Kinect sensor instead. There was thankfully a first generation Kinect available in the IDC office, and a couple of <a href="https://shiffman.net/p5/kinect/">Daniel Schiffman tutorials</a> later, Rashmi and I we were ready to make something.

###### The test setup for running dots. We later used a large wall TV mounted to run the installation.

While going through some of these tutorials, I was fascinated with just the raw data the infrared sensor was capturing. I wondered if I could somehow represent this depth data in 2 dimensions, and came up with the idea of mapping depth to color. Objects closer to the sensor could be warm colors, and objects further away could be cool.

### The result

While we didn't have enough technical expertise to make exactly what we wanted, we tried to make Dots a multisensory experience by having the dots vibrate in reaction to sound.

###### Celebrating the first time we got the code working! <br>Making loud noises (like the high-five) also causes the dots to vibrate.

We played music when we invited people to test the installation, and this made Dots something of a party starter. People called other people and soon we had a party on our hands.
