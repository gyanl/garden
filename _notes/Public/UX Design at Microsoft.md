I did my [[Internship at Microsoft]] at the Hyderbad campus while I was doing my Master's degree in Interaction Design at IDC School of Design, IIT Bombay. I then returned to Microsoft after finishing my degree, and started my first job as a UX Designer. I joined the Canvas Voice team in Noida, which worked on experiences like Dictation, Transcription, Read Aloud and Voice Search across Microsoft apps like Word, Outlook and OneNote.

## Projects at Microsoft

#### Rethinking Read Aloud for mobile

Read Aloud is a text to speech feature in Microsoft Word. It was first introduced on Desktop, where it is frequently used to proof-read documents for tone and typos. Word on mobile devices is used more for consuming documents, and our hypothesis was that Read Aloud would be used differently on mobile devices. I conducted user studies to find out more about how mobile users consume information with voice, and proposed mobile-specific design improvements for Read Aloud. 

#### Presenter Coach for PowerPoint Mobile

Presenter Coach helps users rehearse their presentations with AI-powered live feedback. Things like using too many filler words, repeating phrases and reading off the slides are immediately, and a detailed report is generated at the end of the session. The limited space on mobile devices limited what could be shown to users during a rehearsal, and I prototyped a number of possible visual treatments and tested with users to find what users found most helpful. 

#### Dictation for OneNote mobile

OneNote on mobile devices has a sticky notes for quickly capturing information, as well as fully fledged OneNote notebooks. I conducted user studies to find out how people use voice technologies to capture thoughts - from using recorded memos as reminders, to students recording lectures to review later. I worked with the OneNote team to introduce voice as a new input method for both sticky notes and Onenote notebooks.

#### Transcription in Microsoft Word

Transcription converts audio recordings into a text transcript, with timestamped sections separated by speaker. Snippets from the transcript can then be used in the Word document. I was responsible for using user feedback to improve support for multiple recordings, adding dark mode support, and extending the feature to Windows.

#### Mobile refresh for Word, Excel & PowerPoint

You can do a lot with the Office suite of apps, and for years the apps have used the *Ribbon menu* on desktop to organise all the commands. When the WXP Apps were first launched on mobile, they borrowed the structure of the Ribbon to maintain familiarity, with adaptations to the still-new paradigms of mobile apps. I was part of a team that rethought the aging mobile interface, and created new unified design patterns for commanding and navigation across Word, Excel and PowerPoint.
