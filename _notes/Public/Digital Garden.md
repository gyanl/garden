I've been fascinated by the idea of Digital Gardens for some time now. I really enjoy Andy Matuschak's [working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/), where he writes personal notes but shares them publicly. He calls this [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up)). 

My goals with this website are two-fold.

1. I want a portfolio to document my work as a designer, which means my home page shows only the projects that show off the skills most relevant to my career as a UX Designer.
2. I want a place to write personal reflections, collect useful resources, document personal projects, make notes about things I learned. These can be a little esotericâ€”I have a page for my grandfather's [[Ginger Beer]] recipe, and a page about [[Numeronyms]]. 

#### Website Setup
I used a custom Jekyll theme for my old website, and I am now experimenting with Obsidian as a writing interface combined with Jekyll and GitHub Pages for hosting.
