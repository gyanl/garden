### Books

**The Left Hand of Darkness** by Ursula K. Le Guin
The Left Hand of Darkness felt unlike anything I've ever read. The plot is quite simple, and yet this is one of those books where the plot barely matters.
[[⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5 Stars]]

### Speculative Fiction

**Lena** by qntm
MMAcevedo is the first human brain to be scanned and uploaded, and draws parallels to the Lenna image - an image frequently used as a benchmark for image manipulation algorithms.
